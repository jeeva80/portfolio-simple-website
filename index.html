            <h2 class="section-two__title">About me</h2>
            <p class="section-two__desc">My name is Jeeva Anandan R, and I am a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)
                student with a passion for
                technology and web development. As an aspiring web developer, I enjoy creating functional and visually
                appealing
                websites that provide seamless user experiences. Proficient in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS,
                and
                JavaScript, and familiar with frameworks like React and Bootstrap, I combine technical skills with
                creativity to
                bring ideas to life. I also have a growing interest in back-end development, working with Node.js,
                Express.js,
                and databases such as MongoDB and MySQL, which equips me to understand full-stack development.
                Constantly eager
                to learn and innovate, I stay updated with the latest trends and tools in web development. Outside
                academics, I
                love exploring graphic design and participating in collaborative projects, which enhance my
                problem-solving
                abilities. My goal is to leverage my skills to build impactful digital solutions that make a difference.
